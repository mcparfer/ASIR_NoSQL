# MongoDB Projects Repository

Welcome to my MongoDB projects repository! In this repository, you will find three projects developed with MongoDB. Each project includes `inserts.js` and `queries.js` files, as well as its own Documentation. Below, I will provide a brief description of each project.

## Description

### Project001

Project001 focuses on basic MongoDB operations. It includes insert operations and queries using the find method.

### Project002

Project002 builds upon Project001 knowledge. It includes inserts, queries using the find method, and aggregate operations.

### Project003

Project003 is the most advanced project in this repository. It includes and combines multiple collections, queries using the find method, aggregate operations, and also mongoexport and mongoimport commands.
